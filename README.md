# introduction

some months ago i started to look at using the computer for creating music, initially on macos using the usual programs. as i really like and mainly use linux i had a look what is available there for that purpose and realized, that it is not that easy to get a good and realistic overview on that topic. i found a lot of software, which has not been touched for 5-10 years at all and other software which was really complex to build from source on my own. initially it looked like there are many gaps if one really would like to try to make music end to end just using linux. on the good side there are a few projects trying to make all this a bit easier like kxstudio or lmms, which might be a good start. i decided to go the hard way and build all the stuff i need myself after doing a lot of investigation of what is available at all.

one thing is important to note: if your primary goal is to make music and you can afford the commercial programs on macos or windows, you should have a look at them first at least - with most of them you'll be faster in getting your first things done as they usually have well thought out and ergonomic user interfaces and usually lots of good presets, samples and examples with them. on the linux side it will usually take longer to get used to the programs and their user interfaces, but once you mastered them they can usually be as powerfull and sometimes even more flexible that their commercial brothers and sisters. a nice side effect of going this a bit slower road of learning things on linux is that you'll most probably get a much better understanding of how things work under the hood, which will maybe open new possibilities in working with those tools. the easier to use commercial programs sometimes can be a bit like a black box and as such it might sometimes be harder to go beyond their limits with your ideas.

# outlook

here is what i plan to put here in the near and medium future:

* notes on using some of the programs like ardour, helm, zyn-fusion, vcvrack, sunvox, linuxsampler, argotlunar, ...
* kind of an overview of other music software on linux like tracktion, reaper, ableton live, bitwig studio, fl studio, ...
* procompiled binaries of quite a few sound related applications etc. for linux on x86_64, armhf and aarch64 - all based on ubuntu 18.04
* notes and patches i created or collected while compiling the software, so that other might profit from it as well
* non linux related notes regarding similar software on macos like plugins, ableton live, apple logic, bitwig studio, ...
